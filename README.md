### 🖼️ Sneak Peek of Examples
Here’s a small glimpse of what’s inside:

```javascript
// Example: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
function checkNumber(num) {
  if (num > 0) {
    return "Positive";
  } else if (num < 0) {
    return "Negative";
  } else {
    return "Zero";
  }
}

console.log(checkNumber(5)); // Output: Positive
console.log(checkNumber(-3)); // Output: Negative
